# Guessing_game
This is a simple console-based Guessing Game developed using Java.
The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player must guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides a hint such as “Too high” or “Too low” until the correct answer is found.
The game also counts the number of attempts the player makes to reach the correct guess.
This project is ideal for beginners who want to practice loops, conditional statements, user input, and random number generation in Java.
